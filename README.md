# TriviaGame

## A trivia game where the questions are based on the data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI)

Press Start to play the game. The game will choose a random person from the canon Star Wars universe.
You will run through a series of questions. You have one chance to answer per question. After you answer or run out of time, you will be given a message with feedback to your response. After waiting 5 seconds another question will rollover. Once you have completed all the questions you will be shown the total number of questions you answered correctly.

## Timers
There are two timers implemented in this game. One is used to keep track of the allowable time for answering a question. The second is used to keep track of the time needed to display the message or feedback after each question. When one stops, the other is ran, and vice-versa.

## Star Wars API
Thank you so much to the following people for their work on SWAPI:
* Paul Hallett
* Owen Hallett
* Carvilsi
* Andrea Stagi  

I am relatively new to JavaScript and currently I have not worked out the best way for storing the data, so I have included the JS files containing the results of roughly twenty http requests for People and Planets.
